# Interactive Christmas Tree UI

This repo is the UI built in React for the [Interactive Christmas Tree](https://interactive-christmas-tree.com)

## What is the _Interactive Christmas Tree_?

This is a real Christmas Tree that lives in my home that can be decorated over a [web interface](https://interactive-christmas-tree.com), it is now read-only but you can still view the tree and its status.

### The Lights

<div style="display: flex;">
    <p style="flex: 1">
        Each individual light can be controlled with up to 8 different colours and you can see your change happen in the video stream behind the lights! (Delay is around 3-4 secs)
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1"><img src="images/lights-animation.gif" style="margin: 20px; max-width: 400px"/></div>
</div>

### The Baubles (Ornaments)

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1"><img src="images/bauble-animation.gif" style="margin: 20px; max-width: 400px"/></div>
    <p style="flex: 1">
        And the Baubles (Ornmanents if you're from the U.S.) can be drawn on in an r/place style fashion, and then they will be displayed on small screens hung on the tree
    </p>
</div>

I am happy to answer any questions in my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xdJpf4dZF7)

## Note

This code is a little bit of a state at the minute as it was a bit of a how you say _bodge_ to make the project read-only, I essentially removed the bits that allowed it to change stuff and it seems to of worked. But it does need a clean-up, especially if I do it again next year... ðŸ˜‰
